Shutter Basic
=============

A Basic system to control a shutter via esp8266 and mqtt.
The power consumption is minimal. It only wakes up for several seconds
after two minutes to check the mqtt server for new messages.


TODO
----

* change mqtt structure to json
* test another mqtt library for better reliability
* try to send status every second while working
